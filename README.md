# NodeSlash - The Learn All The Nodes running project

## Current Episode

* [Watch:](http://www.learnallthenodes.com/episodes/33-an-app-aware-console)

Sometimes when you're working on an app you need to be able to run arbitrary commands.  You want to play with your app's modules without running a server.  You just want to be able to execute arbitrary statements and immediately see the results.  You want a REPL, or read-eval-print-loop that knows about your application.

You can achieve this with the basic `node` command and a few `require` statements, but why stop there when you can get crazy with it?  That's exactly what we do in this episode.

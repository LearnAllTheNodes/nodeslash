# NodeSlash - The Learn All The Nodes running project

## Current Episode

* [Watch:](http://www.learnallthenodes.com/episodes/31-nvm-node-version-manager)

So, we've already completed 31 episodes, and I really have no idea how you've actually installed Node.js.  When I started the series, I did so with that bird's-eye overview of how Node works.  I figured you'd stop watching if we didn't get quickly into actually building *something* (even if it was ridiculous), with Node.

In this episode, I'm going to show you how I installed Node and a fantastic tool for managing different Node versions.  Node is under active development, so new versions come out pretty regularly.  With today's episode, you'll be able to experiment with the new ones with ease.

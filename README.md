# NodeSlash - The Learn All The Nodes running project

## Current Episode

* [Watch:](http://www.learnallthenodes.com/episodes/40-npm-link-or-how-to-further-develop-a-node-package)

A couple of episodes ago we made a Node package called `letter-opener`.  I use the term "made" loosely here, because the package doesn't really do anything besides consume a valid name in the global npm namespace.

In this episode, we're going to flesh the package out and in the process show how to do so in the context of the application that actually uses it.

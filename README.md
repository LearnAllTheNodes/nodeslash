# NodeSlash - The Learn All The Nodes running project

## Current Episode

* [Watch:](http://www.learnallthenodes.com/episodes/20-password-authentication-in-node-with-passport-(the-overview)) Password Authentication in Node with Passport (the Overview)

We've actually created a sign in page.  You may not remember it, because it's been a few episodes since we did that.  And if we define "work" as we can submit a username and password and check against them, then yes, it definitely does "work".

But we need more than this.  We're going to have pages that we want to protect.  We want to restrict access to authenticated users.  We want that user authentication to last for more than a single page.  We want our rag-tag adventurers to actually be able to *log in* and not just validate their username and password.

That is exactly this episode's topic, and we solve this with a node package called passport.

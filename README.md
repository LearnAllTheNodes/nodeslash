# NodeSlash - The Learn All The Nodes running project

## Current Episode

* [Watch:](http://www.learnallthenodes.com/episodes/45-validating-user-input-part-2)

A few episodes ago I expressed my disdain for ORMs and ODMs.  I find them to either be a design small in your code or irrelevant.  We're going to dive into the alternatives as we work towards a better app structure.

In this episode though, we're going to show to handle user input without resorting to the crutch of an ODM.

# NodeSlash - The Learn All The Nodes running project

## Current Episode

* [Watch:](http://www.learnallthenodes.com/episodes/35-protecting-against-csrf-attacks-in-node)

Last time we saw the anatomy of a Cross-site Request Forgery attack, or CSRF for short.  We saw how it worked, and what sort of consequences one could expect from such an attack.  It's challenging to pull one off, but it could be pretty bad.  And it's also really hard to detect, since it's the legitimate user who actually ends up performing the action.

In this episode we'll see how to protect against this attack vector.

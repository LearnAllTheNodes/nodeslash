* [Watch:](http://www.learnallthenodes.com/episodes/34-anatomy-of-a-cross-site-request-forgery-attack)

When a site becomes as overwhelmingly successful as NodeSlash and your project are becoming, you'll need to take mind to keep it as secure as possible.  While no amount of security will deter the most determined of attackers, there are a few things we can do that are the digital equivalent of not leaving the front door open with a big sign that says, "haxor me."

In today's episode we're going to learn about an attack vector called cross-site request forgery and a means to deal with it.

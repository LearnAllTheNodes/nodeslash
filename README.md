* [Watch:](http://www.learnallthenodes.com/episodes/39-how-to-send-email-in-node)

If you've ever signed up for any web app, or pretty much browsed anything on the internet for longer than, say, 5 seconds, you've probably come to learn that web sites really like to send emails.  If you're at all responsible for marketing and user retention, you're probably also very aware of the business value in being able to send emails.

Well, there's nothing special about Node that prevents you too from adding to the volume of email floating around the internet.  In this episode we're going to look into one method for sending email in Node.

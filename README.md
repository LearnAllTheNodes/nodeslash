* [Watch:](http://www.learnallthenodes.com/episodes/44-embracing-the-middleware-stack)

Since [Episode #3](http://www.learnallthenodes.com/episodes/3-beginning-routing-in-nodejs) we've been using Express in our application.  The main pain it solved for us was how excruciating routing a request to the correct handler was.  I mean, it was bad.

But Express does more for us than just routing.  In [Episode #5](http://www.learnallthenodes.com/episodes/5-middleware-in-express) we introduced Express's concept of middleware.  Middleware takes repetitive tasks, such as user authentication, and pulls them out of our main request flow.

Could we use middleware to do more than just abstract common operations out of our request?  Could middleware clean up the entire request/response flow?  In this episode, we'll find out that indeed it can.

# NodeSlash - The Learn All The Nodes running project

## Current Episode

* [Watch:](http://www.learnallthenodes.com/episodes/41-templates-in-email)

The past few episodes dealing with email were throwbacks to an earlier time when we were constructing HTML pages out of single-line strings.  I don't know about you, but I was very happy to leave those days behind.  It's time to also leave them behind when it comes to sending our emails.

In this episode we're going to look at how to generate richer email content with less confusion by using email templates.

* [Watch:](http://www.learnallthenodes.com/episodes/24-style-tricks-for-the-design-impaired)

Do you develop great backend systems but find that making a website look nice is a Dark Art?  Do you ever wish there were some easy fixes for that problem?  That totally describes me.

Unfortunately, there's no way to make design easy or mechanical.  But there are few tricks you can drop in to spruce up your struggling pages.  We've already seen how Bootstrap can do wonders for us, but it doesn't stop there.  In this week's episode we look at a few more tricks savvy developers can use to fake the appearance of design skills or that experienced design folks can use to save some initial setup.

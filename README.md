# NodeSlash - The Learn All The Nodes running project

## Current Episode

* [Watch:](http://www.learnallthenodes.com/episodes/29-upgrading-an-actual-app-to-express-4)

n our last few episodes we highlighted some of the useful new features in Express 4, hoping to make the case for why you would want to upgrade an app to it.  We also looked at some functionality we already knew about and how it changed in Express 4.  We looked at all that in the context of a toy app that didn't do anything remotely useful.

In this episode we take our knowledge of Express 4 and apply it to an actual application-- that web sensation NodeSlash.  Why take the time for it?  Well, new features are nice to learn in isolation, but businesses aren't built on toy apps.  And the project you're working on probably isn't tailored just to show off what Express 4 can do.  You work in real code, so you need to see how to upgrade real code.
